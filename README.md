# 25MesaHack  
1)  Just a heads up on how to do this, I was trying to figure it out first. We only need one copy of the code, so first we need Ms.Warrior to delete the stuff u did, Jasmeine, and only keep mine, and we will use that moving forward as the main one.
2)  Secondly, when you are uploading, make sure to delete the old version from your computer before you download and upload. We don't want to upload the wrong thing by accident, and also so that all the files have the same name, and the merge is better.  
3)  Lastly, ask the last person who worked on the code for their permission before you commit a change on GitHub as the main and final version, because that is what we are turning in. Keep that in mind, and if possible, show others what you did/changed, or added before committing to GitHub. If you have an error you can't fix, leave a comment on it, and one of us will try to fix it if possible.  
4)  We only nee to delete these
